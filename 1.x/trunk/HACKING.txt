Process Hacker is developed using Visual Studio 2008, and will only work with
C# compilers which support C# 3.0. It has been tested on Visual Studio 2008
and Visual C# Express Edition (free).

To build KProcessHacker, you will need the Windows DDK.
To build NProcessHacker, you will need Visual Studio 2008 or Visual C++ 
Express Edition (free).

IMPORTANT: If you are using Visual C# Express Edition to compile/run 
Process Hacker, you MUST enable "Show advanced build configurations" in 
Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > General.

The build script relies on ILMerge being present in the default installation
location ("%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe") or in your PATH
environment variable.
In order to build the installer you must have Inno Setup QuickStart Pack v5.3.9
or newer installed, ANSI or Unicode.
