Selection bug. Original text:

    // This is a workaround for a weird selection bug in the LV.
    // To reproduce in Process Hacker:
    // 1. Create a process. Make sure it isn't the last process in 
    //    the list.
    // 2. Terminate the process. The process row is now red.
    // 3. Quickly click on the last process in the list before the 
    //    process row actually gets deleted.
    // 4. Wait until the process row gets deleted, and click on 
    //    another process.
    // 5. There are now two processes selected.
    // The workaround is to deselect/reselect the last item in the list.
    // This bug DOESN'T occur when there are processes other than 
    // the last one selected.
    // This bug DOES occur when you insert a step between 3 and 4: 
    // Quickly sort by another column, even if we do a check on the 
    // last node in the list. Therefore, the workaround has to apply 
    // to all nodes.
