As part of the Process Hacker project and the phlib source code, 
I have created a set of NT header files. These definitions were 
gathered from the following sources:

* Official Microsoft sources
* Alex Ionescu's NDK
* ReactOS header files
* My own reverse engineering

In most cases I have modified the definitions to be more 
consistent.

The handle table package (handle.c) is extremely similar to 
the EX handle table from the NT kernel. The queued lock 
(queuedlock.c) is also somewhat similar to the pushlock 
from the NT kernel. These have been based upon both the 
applicable ReactOS code and reverse engineering of the kernel.

Process Hacker also uses:

* MD5 code by Jouni Malinen (md5.c)
* SHA1 code by Steve Reid (sha.c)
