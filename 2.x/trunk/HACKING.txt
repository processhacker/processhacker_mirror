== Building ==
Process Hacker must be built using a Microsoft C compiler. 
Do not attempt to use any other compiler or be prepared to 
spend a long time trying to fix things. The only tested 
IDE is Visual Studio 2008. Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition 
may or may not work. It is recommended that the x64 compiler 
be installed even if you are not intending to build for that 
platform.

== Code structure ==
There are multiple modules; each .c file can contain one or 
more modules. There are multiple modules in each abstraction 
layer, and there is generally a .h file for each abstraction 
layer.

Abstraction layers and their modules:

* Base (base.h)

* PH Base (phbase.h)
  * NT definitions and imports (ntimport.h, ntimport.c)
  * Object manager (ref.h, ref.c)
  * Fast resource lock (fastlock.h, fastlock.c)
  * Base support (basesup.c)
    * Heap
    * Mutex
    * Event
    * String
    * ANSI String
    * String Builder
    * List
    * Pointer List
    * Queue
    * Hashtable
    * Callback
    * Callback Sync
  * Base support with auto-dereference support (basesupa.c)
    * String
  * Work Queue (workqueue.c)

* PH (ph.h)
  * KProcessHacker (kph.h, kph.c)
  * NT object support (native.c)
  * Handle information (hndlinfo.c)
  * Image verification (verify.c)
  * Provider (provider.c)
  * Symbol provider (symprv.c)
  * Process provider (prcprv.c)
  * Service provider (srvprv.c)
  * Module provider (modprv.c)
  * Thread provider (thrdprv.c)
  * Handle provider (hndlprv.c)
  * General support (support.c)

* PH GUI (phgui.h)
  * Settings (settings.h, settings.c)
