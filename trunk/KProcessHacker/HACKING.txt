==== KProcessHacker ====

== IMPORTANT ==
KProcessHacker has been developed from either reverse engineering of 
the Windows kernel or ReactOS code (http://www.reactos.org). The 
following files contain "ported" ReactOS code (with modifications):

 * mm.c
   * MiDoMappedCopy
   * MiDoPoolCopy (added smarter buffer management)
   * MiGetExceptionInfo
 * ps.c
   * KphOpenProcess
   * KphOpenThread
 * se.c
   * KphOpenProcessTokenEx

== CODE STRUCTURE ==
 * hook.c
   - Contains hooking code. Currently you may hook any kernel-mode 
     function and object type open procedures.
 * kph.c
   - Contains support routines
 * kprocesshacker.c
   - Contains interfacing code, mainly consisting of the I/O control 
     handler.
 * mm.c
   - Contains memory-related code, such as reading and writing.
 * ob.c
   - Contains object-related code, such as handle duplication.
 * protect.c
   - Contains process protection code. Process protection is 
     achieved by hooking ObOpenObjectByPointer and some object type 
     OpenProcedures.
 * ps.c
   - Contains process- and thread-related code, such as opening and 
     terminating.
 * se.c
   - Contains security-related code. Only function there is 
     KphOpenProcessTokenEx.
 * sync.c
   - "Processor lock" code. Explained in the code comments.
 * version.c
   - Contains Windows-version-specific data.
