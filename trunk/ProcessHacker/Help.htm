    <p><em><strong>Process Hacker</strong></em></p>

    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker is a tool to view and manipulate processes and services. It can display process' threads,
    modules, memory regions and handles, search through process memory, and read/write memory using 
    a built-in hex editor.</p>

    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Vista or 7, <strong>32-bit</strong> (Windows XP SP3 and 
      Windows Vista SP1 required for certain features)</li>
      <li>.NET Framework 2.0</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Configuration Files</h2>
    <p>On Windows Vista, the configuration files for Process Hacker are stored in 
    <code>AppData\Local\wj32</code>. On Windows XP, they are stored in 
    <code>Local Settings\Application Data\wj32</code>.</p>
    
    <h1 id="options">Options</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker's options are accessible from the <strong>Options</strong> menu item 
    in the <strong>Hacker</strong> menu.</p>
    
    <h2>General</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Update Interval</dt>
      <dd>The amount of time in milliseconds between each <em>update</em>; i.e, when 
      Process Hacker looks for new, modified or removed processes, services and other objects.</dd>
      
      <dt>Processes in icon menu</dt>
      <dd>The number of processes to display in the notification icon menu.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Engine</dt>
      <dd>This is used by the <strong>Search Online...</strong> menu item in the process and module 
      context menus. <code>%s</code> is replaced by the name of the selected process or module.</dd>
      
      <dt>Require Signatures</dt>
      <dd>If <strong>Verify signatures and perform additional checks</strong> is enabled, this 
      specifies the processes that must have a valid signature. Processes with a <em>name</em> 
      that is specified in this field and do not have a valid signature will be highlighted 
      as a <em>Packed/Dangerous Process</em> (see Higlighting options).</dd>
      
      <dt>Max. Size Unit</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the maximum unit of size; sizes which can be displayed as 1024 or less in a 
      smaller unit will be displayed in that smaller unit, while sizes requiring a larger unit will 
      use units up to the maximum unit specified here.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when minimized</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide itself when it is minimized. You 
      can double-click on the notification icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when closed</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide itself when it is closed. You 
      can double-click on the notification icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Start hidden</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will start hidden. You can double-click on the notification 
      icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Allow only one instance</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will allow only one instance of itself. Any attempts to start 
      a new instance will show the existing instance.</dd>
      
      <dt>Show user/group domains</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will show the domain of users and groups: <code>user</code> 
      would be shown as <code>machine-name\user</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Advanced</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Enable kernel-mode driver</dt>
      <dd>Some handles cannot be displayed by a user-mode program like Process Hacker; this 
      option enables <em>KProcessHacker</em> which allows Process Hacker 
      to display all handles and bypass rootkits/security software. If enabled, it will be 
      loaded the next time Process Hacker is started.<br />
      Specifically, it provides Process Hacker 
      with the following features:<br />
      The ability to display all file handles,<br />
      The ability to open any process or thread without being intercepted by rootkits/security 
      software, and<br />
      The ability to protect and unprotect processes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Verify signatures and perform additional checks</dt>
      <dd>This option affects newly created processes, and controls whether Process Hacker will 
      attempt to verify the digital signatures of processes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Replace Task Manager with Process Hacker</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, any attempt to start Task Manager will start Process Hacker instead.</dd>

      <dt>Warn about potentially dangerous actions</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will warn about certain actions to system processes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide handles with no name</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, unnamed handles will be hidden by default. This can be changed in each 
      process properties window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide Process Hacker network connections</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, network connections made by Process Hacker will be hidden in the network 
      connections list.</dd>
      
      <dt>Max. Sample History</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the maximum number of performance-related samples to be retained. This includes 
      CPU, I/O and memory usage data for the system and all processes.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Highlighting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Highlighting Duration</dt>
      <dd>This specifies the amount of time for which new and removed objects (processes, threads and services) 
      are highlighted in a different color.</dd>
      
      <dt>New Objects</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for new processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions, and handles.</dd>
      
      <dt>Removed Objects</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for terminated/deleted processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions and 
      handles.</dd>
      
      <dt>Own Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes running under the same user account as Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>System Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes running under the SYSTEM user account.</dd>
      
      <dt>Service Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes hosting one or more services.</dd>
      
      <dt>Debugged Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes currently being debugged.</dd>
      
      <dt>Elevated Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes running with full privileges on a computer with 
      User Account Control (UAC) enabled.</dd>
      
      <dt>Job Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes associated with a job object.</dd>
      
      <dt>.NET Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for managed processes. Note that this currently only 
      highlights pure CLR executables - mixed code executables and processes hosting 
      .NET code will not be highlighted.</dd>
      
      <dt>Packed/Dangerous Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for packed images and images with invalid signatures. These processes 
      are often, but not always malicious - normal executables are often packed to reduce their 
      size.</dd>
      
      <dt>Suspended Threads</dt>
      <dd>Threads which have been suspended.</dd>
      
      <dt>GUI Threads</dt>
      <dd>Threads which have made at least one GUI-related system call.</dd>
      
      <dt>Protected Handles</dt>
      <dd>Handles which are protected from being closed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Inherit Handles</dt>
      <dd>Handles which will be inherited by child processes.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Plotting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use Anti-aliasing</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will draw graphs with anti-aliasing. This will 
      usually consume much more system resources than normal.</dd>
      
      <dt>Step</dt>
      <dd>This option controls the distance in pixels between each data point.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Symbols</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Dbghelp.dll path</dt>
      <dd>Select the path to the most recent version of dbghelp.dll you have 
      installed on your computer. If you do not have the latest version, go to 
      <code>http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx</code> and 
      download Debugging Tools for Windows.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search path</dt>
      <dd>Type in a symbol server path. Most users will want to use the following: 
      <code>SRV*<strong>C:\Users\USERNAME\Symbols</strong>*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</code>. 
      This will have any needed symbols downloaded from Microsoft's symbol server to 
      the specified directory (in bold).</dd>
      
      <dt>Undecorate symbols</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, C++ symbol names will be undecorated (unmangled). This is most 
      useful for methods with complex signatures.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="numberinput">Number Input</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker supports the input of numbers in various bases (including some non-standard
    extensions). This is allowed in: Get Function Address, Change Memory Protection, the Go To
    box in Read/Write Memory, and the insertion of numbers through the <strong>Utilities</strong>
    button.</p>
    <p>A number is assumed to be in base 10 unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It starts with <code>0</code> (zero) - octal (base 8)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>0x</code> - hexadecimal (base 16)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>b</code> - binary (base 2)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>t</code> - ternary (base 3)</li>		
      <li>It starts with <code>q</code> - quaternary (base 4)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>w</code> - base 12</li>				
      <li>It starts with <code>r</code> - base 32</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1 id="proctree">Process Tree</h1>
    <p>The process tree displays processes running on the system as a tree; processes started by a 
    particular parent process are shown indented below it. Processes with a non-existent parent 
    (where its parent has terminated) are shown on the far left. You can manipulate processes by 
    right-clicking on them, and you can show detailed properties for a process by double-clicking 
    it or selecting the "Properties..." menu item.</p>
    
    <p>You can sort by the various columns by clicking on them - the tree view will temporarily 
    become a flat list. You can click the same column again to sort in the reverse order, and 
    once more to return to the tree view.</p>
    
    <p>Like Process Explorer, Process Hacker shows Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs) and Interrupts 
    in the process tree. The only information these "processes" show is their CPU usage.</p>
    
    <h2>Context Menu</h2>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Manipulating csrss.exe, dwm.exe, lsass.exe, lsm.exe, smss.exe,
    winlogon.exe or any other system processes is not recommended and may lead to system instability or
    a crash.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Terminate Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the selected process(es). If KProcessHacker is enabled, Process Hacker 
      will, except under extraordinary circumstances, be able to terminate any process, 
      including ones protected by rootkits or security software.</dd>

      <dt>Terminate Process Tree</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the selected process and its descendants.</dd>

      <dt>Suspend Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Suspends the selected process(es). If KProcessHacker is enabled and running on 
      Windows Vista, Process Hacker will be able to suspend any process, including ones 
      protected by rootkits or security software.</dd>

      <dt>Resume Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Resumes the selected process(es). If KProcessHacker is enabled and running on 
      Windows Vista, Process Hacker will be able to resume any process, including ones 
      protected by rootkits or security software.</dd>
      
      <dt>Restart</dt>
      <dd>Restarts the selected process with the same command line arguments and working 
      directory.</dd>
      
      <dt>Reduce Working Set</dt>
      <dd>Empties the selected process(es)' working set(s). 
      This is a safe function; the process will eventually reclaim most of its working set.</dd>
      
      <dt>Virtualization</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to enable or disable virtualization for the selected process, if allowed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Affinity...</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to view and modify the process' CPU affinity (the CPUs on which it is allowed 
      to run).</dd>
      
      <dt>Inject DLL...</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to select a DLL file (or any other PE image) that will be injected into 
      the selected process. This option is only available for processes running in the same 
      session as Process Hacker (usually processes in the same user account).</dd>
      
      <dt>Terminator...</dt>
      <dd>A tool which tries to terminate the selected process using many different techniques.</dd>

      <dt>Priority</dt>
      <dd>Sets the process's priority - Real Time, High, Above Normal, Normal, Below Normal, Idle.
      This option is not available when multiple processes are selected.</dd>
      
      <dt>Run As</dt>
      <dd>These tools require <code>Assistant.exe</code> (distributed with Process Hacker) to be in the same directory 
      as <code>ProcessHacker.exe</code>.<br />
      <strong>Launch As User...</strong> - This allows you to run the selected process as another user.<br />
      <strong>Launch As This User...</strong> - This allows you to run a program under the selected process' user. This 
      is useful when you want to start a program as another user but you do not have that user's password.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Online...</dt>
      <dd>Opens the default web browser with the search engine specified in Process Hacker's options.</dd>
      
      <dt>Re-analyze</dt>

    </dl>

    <h1 id="procprops">Process Properties</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>General</dt>
      <dd>Displays basic information about the process and its image file. You can also view the 
      process' PEB contents, view/change its DEP status (requires Windows XP SP3 or higher, and 
      changing DEP status uses remote thread injection), and protect/unprotect it (requires 
      Windows Vista).</dd>
      
      <dt>Statistics</dt>
      <dd>Displays statistics and performance information.</dd>

    </dl>

    <h1 id="memsearch">Searching Memory</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker supports searching using a literal string or regular expressions. To 
    perform a search, open a Properties window for a process, select the <strong>Memory</strong> 
    tab and select an option in the search button. A window will appear in which you can 
    enter the data to search for. You can also control the types of memory regions to search.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Literal Search</dt>

    <dl>
      <dt>Insert Number</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to insert numbers in various formats - 8 to 64-bit, little or big endian.</dd>

      <dt>Insert String</dt>
      <dd>Similarly, this allows you to insert strings in various encodings - ASCII, UTF-8 to UTF-32.
      If a multiline item is selected, the prompt box will have a multiline textbox.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>In the search results list, double-clicking an item will open the Memory Editor with
    the search result highlighted.</p>
    
    <h2>Sample Regex Searches</h2>
    <p>All of these samples must have <strong>Ignore Case</strong> selected.</p>
    
    <p>A valid filesystem character is <code>[ a-z0-9`~';!@#\$%\^&\-_=+\,\.\(\)\[\]\{\}]</code>

    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="results">Results Window</h1>
    <p>The Results Window is displayed when searching for data, scanning for strings or 
    scanning for heaps. There are five buttons at the top of the window:</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Refresh</dt>
      <dd>This performs the search again.</dd>
      
      <dt>Edit Search</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to edit the search type and data associated with the Results Window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Filter</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to filter the search results, creating a new Results Window containing 
      the matching items. To filter using a numerical relation, enter the relation (for example, 
      greater than or equal to <code>&gt;=</code>) followed by the number. If the filter 
      (<code>&gt;=10</code>) is applied to the <strong>Length</strong> column, all items with a 
      length greater than or equal 10 will be displayed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Intersect</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to select another Results Window. It then creates a third Results Window
      in which the search results present in both Results Windows are displayed. This allows you
      to filter search results.</dd>
      
      <dt>Save...</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to save the search results to a text file.</dd>
