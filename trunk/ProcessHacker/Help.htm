    <p><em><strong>Process Hacker</strong>, by wj32 and Dean.</em></p>

    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker is a tool to view and manipulate processes and services. It can display process' threads,
    modules, memory regions and handles, search through process memory, and read/write memory using 
    a built-in hex editor.</p>

    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or Vista, <strong>32-bit</strong> (Windows XP SP3 and 
      Windows Vista SP1 required for certain features)</li>
      <li>.NET Framework 2.0</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Configuration Files</h2>
    <p>On Windows Vista, the configuration files for Process Hacker are stored in 
    <code>AppData\Local\wj32</code>.</p>

    <h2>Other Process Viewers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Process Viewer from CTi - http://www.teamcti.com/pview/prcview.htm
      </li>
      <li>
        Process Viewer from NirSoft - http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cprocess.html
      </li>
      <li>
        Process Explorer - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1 id="options">Options</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker's options are accessible from the <strong>Options</strong> menu item 
    in the <strong>Hacker</strong> menu.</p>
    
    <h2>General</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Update Interval</dt>
      <dd>The amount of time in milliseconds between each <em>update</em>; i.e, when 
      Process Hacker looks for new, modified or removed processes and services.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Engine</dt>
      <dd>This is used by the <strong>Search Online...</strong> menu item in the process and module 
      context menus. <code>%s</code> is replaced by the name of the selected process or module.</dd>
      
      <dt>Require Signatures</dt>
      <dd>If <strong>Verify signatures and perform additional checks</strong> is enabled, this 
      specifies the processes that must have a valid signature. Processes with a <em>name</em> 
      that is specified in this field and do not have a valid signature will be highlighted 
      as a <em>Packed/Dangerous Process</em> (see Higlighting options).</dd>
      
      <dt>Max. Size Unit</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the maximum unit of size; sizes which can be displayed as 1024 or less in a 
      smaller unit will be displayed in that smaller unit, while sizes requiring a larger unit will 
      use units up to the maximum unit specified here.</dd>
      
      <dt>Show tray icon</dt>
      <dd>When this option is enabled, Process Hacker will display an icon in the system tray area. 
      That icon will show the CPU usage history and any enabled notifications such as new/terminated 
      processes and new/started/stopped/deleted services. You can configure notifications by 
      right-clicking on the icon.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when minimized</dt>
      <dd>When this option is enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide when it is minimized. You 
      can double-click on the tray icon to show Process Hacker again.</dd>
      
      <dt>Warn about potentially dangerous actions</dt>
      <dd>When this option is enabled, Process Hacker will warn about certain actions to system processes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Show user/group domains</dt>
      <dd>When this option is enabled, Process Hacker will show the domain of users and groups: <code>user</code> 
      would be shown as <code>machine-name\user</code>.</dd>
      
      <dt>Verify signatures and perform additional checks</dt>
      <dd>This option affects newly created processes, and controls whether Process Hacker will 
      attempt to verify the digital signatures of processes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Enable experimental kernel-mode driver</dt>
      <dd>Some handles cannot be displayed by a user-mode program like Process Hacker; this 
      option enables the experimental driver <em>KProcessHacker</em> which allows Process Hacker 
      to display all handles and bypass rootkits/security software. If enabled, it will be 
      loaded the next time Process Hacker is started.<br />
      Specifically, it provides Process Hacker 
      with the following features:<br />
      The ability to display all file handles,<br />
      The ability to open any process or thread without being intercepted by rootkits/security 
      software,<br />
      The ability to protect and unprotect processes.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Highlighting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Highlighting Duration</dt>
      <dd>This specifies the amount of time for which new and removed objects (processes, threads and services) 
      are highlighted in a different color.</dd>
      
      <dt>New Objects</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for new processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions, and handles.</dd>
      
      <dt>Removed Objects</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for terminated/deleted processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions and 
      handles.</dd>
      
      <dt>Own Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes running under the same user account as Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>System Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes running under the SYSTEM user account.</dd>
      
      <dt>Service Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes hosting one or more services.</dd>
      
      <dt>Debugged Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes currently being debugged.</dd>
      
      <dt>Elevated Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes running with full privileges on a computer with 
      User Account Control (UAC) enabled.</dd>
      
      <dt>Job Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for processes associated with a job object.</dd>
      
      <dt>.NET Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for managed processes. Note that this currently only 
      highlights pure CLR executables - mixed code executables and processes hosting 
      .NET code will not be highlighted.</dd>
      
      <dt>Packed/Dangerous Processes</dt>
      <dd>Highlighting for packed images and images with invalid signatures. These processes 
      are often, but not always malicious - normal executables are often packed to reduce their 
      size.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Plotting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use Anti-aliasing</dt>
      <dd>If selected, Process Hacker will draw graphs with anti-aliasing. This will 
      usually consume much more system resources than normal.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="numberinput">Number Input</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker supports the input of numbers in various bases (including some non-standard
    extensions). This is allowed in: Get Function Address, Change Memory Protection, the Go To
    box in Read/Write Memory, and the insertion of numbers through the <strong>Utilities</strong>
    button.</p>
    <p>A number is assumed to be in base 10 unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It starts with <code>0</code> (zero) - octal (base 8)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>0x</code> - hexadecimal (base 16)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>b</code> - binary (base 2)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>t</code> - ternary (base 3)</li>		
      <li>It starts with <code>q</code> - quaternary (base 4)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>w</code> - base 12</li>				
      <li>It starts with <code>r</code> - base 32</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="proctree">Process Tree</h1>
    <p>The process tree displays processes running on the system as a tree; processes started by a 
    particular parent process are shown indented below it. Processes with a non-existent parent 
    (where its parent has terminated) are shown on the far left. You can manipulate processes by 
    right-clicking on them, and you can show detailed properties for a process by double-clicking 
    it or selecting the "Properties..." menu item.</p>
    
    <p>You can sort by the various columns by clicking on them - the tree view will temporarily 
    become a flat list. You can click the same column again to sort in the opposite order, and 
    once more to return to the tree view.</p>
    
    <p>Like Process Explorer, Process Hacker shows Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs) and Interrupts 
    in the process tree. The only information these "processes" show is their CPU usage.</p>

    <h2>Context Menu</h2>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Manipulating csrss.exe, dwm.exe, lsass.exe, lsm.exe, smss.exe,
    winlogon.exe or any other system processes is not recommended and may lead to system instability or
    a crash.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Terminate Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Uses the <code>TerminateProcess()</code> API function to terminate the selected 
      process(es).</dd>

      <dt>Suspend Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Uses the <code>NtSuspendProcess()</code> API function to suspend the selected
      process(es).</dd>

      <dt>Resume Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Uses the <code>NtResumeProcess()</code> API function to resume the selected 
      process(es).</dd>
      
      <dt>Affinity...</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to view and modify the process' CPU affinity (the CPUs on which it is allowed 
      to run).</dd>
      
      <dt>Terminator...</dt>
      <dd>A tool which tries to terminate the selected process using many different techniques.</dd>

      <dt>Priority</dt>
      <dd>Sets the process's priority - Real Time, High, Above Normal, Normal, Below Normal, Idle.
      This option is not available when multiple processes are selected.</dd>
      
      <dt>Run As</dt>
      <dd>These tools require <code>Assistant.exe</code> (distributed with Process Hacker) to be in the same directory 
      as <code>ProcessHacker.exe</code>.<br />
      <strong>Launch As User...</strong> - This allows you to run the selected process as another user.<br />
      <strong>Launch As This User...</strong> - This allows you to run a program under the selected process' user. This 
      is useful when you want to start a program as another user but you do not have that user's password.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Online...</dt>
      <dd>Opens the default web browser with the search engine specified in Process Hacker's options.</dd>

      <dt>Select All</dt>
      <dd>Selects all items in the list.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h1 id="procprops">Process Properties</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>General</dt>
      <dd>Displays basic information about the process and its image file. You can also view the 
      process' PEB contents, view/change its DEP status (requires Windows XP SP3 or higher, and 
      changing DEP status uses remote thread injection), and protect/unprotect it (requires 
      Windows Vista).</dd>
      
      <dt>Statistics</dt>
      <dd>Displays statistics and performance information.</dd>
      
      <dt>Performance</dt>
      <dd>Displays three graphs relating to the process' performance - CPU Usage, 
      Memory Usage, and I/O activity.</dd>
      
      <dt>Threads</dt>
      <dd>Displays the process' threads, including their symbolic start addresses. You can click on 
      a thread to view more information, or double-click a thread to view its call stack.</dd>
      
      <dt>Token</dt>
      <dd>Displays the process' primary token. On Windows Vista with UAC enabled, you can also 
      click on the <strong>Linked Token...</strong> button to view the token associated with 
      the process' token. You can also enable and disable privileges.</dd>
      
      <dt>Modules</dt>
      <dd>Displays the modules loaded by the process. Right-click a module for more options.</dd>
      
      <dt>Memory</dt>
      <dd>Displays the process' virtual memory regions. Double-click a memory region to 
      read/write its contents, and right-click a memory region to perform other actions. You can 
      also search memory using the search button (see below).</dd>
      
      <dt>Handles</dt>
      <dd>Displays the process' handles - resources it has opened. You can right-click a handle and 
      close it.</dd>
      
      <dt>Services</dt>
      <dd>Displays services that are registered in the process.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h1 id="memsearch">Searching Memory</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker supports searching using a literal string or regular expressions. To 
    perform a search, open a Properties window for a process, select the <strong>Memory</strong> 
    tab and select an option in the search button. A window will appear in which you can 
    enter the data to search for. You can also control the types of memory regions to search.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Literal Search</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to enter a sequence of bytes to search for.</dd>
      
      <dt>Regex Search</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to search using regular expressions.</dd>
      
      <dt>String Scan</dt>
      <dd>Scans for strings inside the process' memory.</dd>
      
      <dt>Heap Scan</dt>
      <dd>Displays a list of heap blocks.</dd>
      
      <dt>Struct Search</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to search for addresses which match the selected struct.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>In the <strong>Literal</strong> tab, there is a small button in the bottom-right 
    which allows you to insert data in various formats.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Insert Number</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to insert numbers in various formats - 8 to 64-bit, little or big endian.</dd>

      <dt>Insert String</dt>
      <dd>Similarly, this allows you to insert strings in various encodings - ASCII, UTF-8 to UTF-32.
      If a multiline item is selected, the prompt box will have a multiline textbox.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>In the search results list, double-clicking an item will open the Memory Editor with
    the search result highlighted.</p>
    
    <h2>Sample Regex Searches</h2>
    <p>All of these samples must have <strong>Ignore Case</strong> selected.</p>
    
    <p>A valid filesystem character is <code>[ a-z0-9`~';!@#\$%\^&\-_=+\,\.\(\)\[\]\{\}]</code>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Email address</dt>
      <dd><code>[a-z0-9_\-\.]+@[a-z0-9_\-\.]+\.(au|biz|ca|com|info|net|org|uk|zh)</code></dd>
      
      <dt>Path name</dt>
      <dd><code>[A-Z]:\\([ a-z0-9`~'!@#\$%\^&\-_=+\,\.\(\)\[\]\{\}]*\\)*([ a-z0-9`~'!@#\$%\^&\-_=+\,\.\(\)\[\]\{\}]*)(\\)*</code></dd>
      
      <dt>Executable file</dt>
      <dd><code>([ a-z0-9`~'!@#\$%\^&\-_=+\,\.\(\)\[\]\{\}])+\.(bat|com|dll|exe)</code></dd>
      
      <dt>URL</dt>
      <dd>(file|ftp|http):///*[a-z0-9%\/ .\-_:\(\)\[\]]+</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="results">Results Window</h1>
    <p>The Results Window is displayed when searching for data, scanning for strings or 
    scanning for heaps. There are five buttons at the top of the window:</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Refresh</dt>
      <dd>This performs the search again.</dd>
      
      <dt>Edit Search</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to edit the search type and data associated with the Results Window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Filter</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to filter the search results, creating a new Results Window containing 
      the matching items. To filter using a numerical relation, enter the relation (for example, 
      greater than or equal to <code>&gt;=</code>) followed by the number. If the filter 
      (<code>&gt;=10</code>) is applied to the <strong>Length</strong> column, all items with a 
      length greater than or equal 10 will be displayed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Intersect</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to select another Results Window. It then creates a third Results Window
      in which the search results present in both Results Windows are displayed. This allows you
      to filter search results.</dd>
      
      <dt>Save...</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to save the search results to a text file.</dd>
    </dl>
